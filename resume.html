            My resume
          </h3>
          <p>
            My name is Lin Qiaofeng. I was born in a small mountain village in China. I especially liked computers since I was a child. However, because my family was poor and didn't have any materials to learn, I went to college and taught myself a lot of programming languages, such as Java, python, PHP, golang, JS, CSS and so on. I also found a good job because I didn't learn rural English well when I was a child, So I want to study the advanced programming knowledge of foreign countries, so I participated in the study of IIT. Thank you very much for your confidence and teaching.

            Why should I learn programming
          </h3>
          <p>
            I believe there are many such people. I was very interested when I first came into contact. As for such people, I think there is no way to suggest. Interest is the best teacher. As long as I am interested and willing to study, my technical level will gradually improve. Of course, I have one suggestion: pay attention to good health; A balanced life means that we have more than jobs in our lives There are several such friends around me. They were very good in college. C, computer and compilation are all full marks. They won the National Award in ACM. During college, they just like to write programs and do some new things. They are really incomparable. They go to big factories after graduation. Now they are estimated to earn millions a year. Let it go

            How to better entry programming
          </h3>
          <p>
            People around us always associate coding, programmers, and baldness, and feel that this is a difficult thing. For those of us who are interested in programming, we can't think of programming too hard. Of course, here There is no quick fix either.I think the score starts from several stages. When you first start, you need to watch other people's videos and the like, follow the seniors, take notes, be able to do exercises, and master the basics.After you have a certain foundation, you need to learn more. You can't just show the surface, you can't just practice without thinking, but you should have a deep understanding at a certain point, thinking that we are all for serving in our work, and often we write The process of the program is very short, and it takes most of the time to find bugs and changes. So think and practice, and lay a solid foundation.When we have this kind of knowledge, I think there is a higher requirement, how to write the code well, easy to transplant, clear structure, this thinking needs to be raised, we need to know more, this is A process that takes time
