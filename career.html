          I will complete the iit course in the next 2 years, because I fill out the volunteers in the third year of high school and do not tick the option of obeying the allocation, so I am not going to the major that I want. In addition to taking the course of my own major in the university, because of my love for computers, I have to go to computer courses. So computer studies are also done. So getting a degree in the major I want is my dream. Currently working as the technical director of the company, this is a technical position, which requires continuous learning to improve his research and development capabilities.
